  storyText: "Your eyes open sharply. You\u2019re laying flat on your stomach with
    limbs out like a white chalk tracing of your final resting place.\n\u201CWhere
    am I?\u201D you think to yourself. You remain still as if to keep your change
    in conscious state unnoticed by your foreign surroundings.\nThe last thing you
    remember is running down an alley and looking quickly back for a moment at the
    sound of a sudden high pitch constant frequency. Your vision faded to black and
    all sounds immediately drowned out. \nThe memory of the alley is faint. It was
    right off the street painted over in reflective neon glows which had lit your
    pursuit. Air conditioners were exposed over tile flooring through time-worn darkened
    areas that were meant to be forgotten about.\nYou were pursuing what appeared
    to be a shadowy figure that moved away seemingly in anticipation of your next
    steps while not looking back. \nThis was the make or break moment in your case
    that was meant to answer all questions about who you are, what you were, and possibly
    who you could become. \u201CHow did I let it get away!?\u201D you scream in your
    mind with defeat. \nAs you consider your options you note your body is colder
    than normal. You can only see the metallic wall in front of you and the grating
    floor beneath you. You can see through the grating but it\u2019s black as if you\u2019re
    suspended in a cage.\n\nWhat do you do?\n\n1. Close your eyes a little longer
    and wait to see what happens.\n2. Push yourself up slowly, stand up and look around.\n3.
    Call out for help.\n"
