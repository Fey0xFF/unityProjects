  storyText: "The door up close is unsightly to see. It appears the door is somewhat
    alive for what it could be an is in pain with the opening being tied back.\n\nLooking
    through the opening and navigating your eyes through the darkness, you see a room
    in the distance. A small narrow light suggests the path is longer than you'd like
    to get through to. Pausing and weighing your options you can hear distant footsteps
    in the path, shuffling about, and fidgeting. A whimpering of a young child can
    be heard now and then.\n\n\"I don't seem to have any other option here do I...\"
    you tell yourself.\n\nWhat do you do?\n\n1. Return. \n2. Go through the opening."
