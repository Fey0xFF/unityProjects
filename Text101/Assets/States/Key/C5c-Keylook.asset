  storyText: "Turning on the gas to the burner you use the lighter to get a flame
    going.\n\n\"Got it!\" you scream in excitement! The strength of the flame should
    be enough to read the key inscription now.\n\nHolding the key above the flame
    you can see the inscription lift up in visibility by the gentle glow of the flame.
    \n\n-It surrounded your cage...\n\n\"What does that mean!?\" you furiously question
    to yourself. Defeated yet still with some strength you mutter \"What madness is
    this place...\" \n\nYou pause in thought for some time reflecting on what you've
    experienced so far. You begin to shutter your eyelids open and closed trying to
    recollect whatever memory you once had and how you actually got it. The time passes
    as you press your mind for answers when suddenly a long drawn out groaning sound
    is heard behind you!\n\n1. Turn around."
