  storyText: 'Looking around the burn ward you can see most of the ground has now
    faded away into the metal grated familiar floor you have seen before. While there
    wasn''t a breeze before, the charred bits of ash are floating around the room
    as if disturbed.


    The figure now more partial than before remains in the distance.


    An uneasy feeling passes as you hear infrequent footsteps now and then with no
    discernable pattern, and a low but continuous generator buzzing in the background.


    "I should probably make my way out of here now..." you weigh in to your thoughts.


    1. Look toward the figure again.

    2. Return to the gardened area.'
