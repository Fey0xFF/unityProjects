  storyText: 'The room is very dimly lit with light seeping in through the smallest
    of edges on the windows around the room. The windows themselves are boarded up.
    Around the room you can just make out some of the objects, a row of chairs, a
    check in counter and two doors. Above the doors, one reads "North Ward" and the
    other "South Ward". There was once another doorway with a revolving door that
    appears to take you outside but it''s completely chained up and locked.


    It appears to be a hospital environment yet certainly abandoned without use for
    some time. The floor has papers and various objects scattered as if the last inhabitants
    left in a hurry.


    You recall to yourself you''re still in posession of the key.


    What do you do?


    1. Examine the key.

    2. To the North Ward.

    3. To the South Ward.'
