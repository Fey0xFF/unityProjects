  storyText: "This room is torn between two different states. It is a small garden
    with a skylight above that is mostly covered with only a few shards of light entering.
    The grass has grown stunted with the lack of light yet surprisingly a fairly sturdy
    tree without leaves rests in the middle. You think to try reading the key against
    the light but it isn't strong enough to catch any reflection of the scribed text
    on it.\n\nThere is a small portable burner that you would take camping atop a
    table that looks like it was set for a meal but never was met by those intended
    to receive it. \n\nOn one side of the room you note a door ornamented with design
    that at a glance could appear to have facial characteristics to it. There are
    two large pull ring handles to the top and a large wreath about the center with
    jagged features on the inside. \"Strange...\" you say to yourself squinting a
    look at it.\n\nAcross the face like door is another door barred up that reads
    \"Burn Ward\". You suspect this area is something of an outdoor relief area to
    the burn ward just beyond it for it's poor inhabitants.\n\nThe only sounds you've
    heard so far have been your hollow footsteps on sorrowful looking grounds. \n\nWhat
    do you do?\n \n1. Ignite the burner to read the key.\n2. To the face door."
