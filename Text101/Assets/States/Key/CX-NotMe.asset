  storyText: "You lift your fingers slowly across the page inking your thoughts.\n\n-It
    wasn't me!\n\nAs you lift your hands away, the book slams shut with such force
    that it gains some lift. Looking up you see a window you never noticed before.
    Walking toward it you're caught by the scenic view outside. Great green rolling
    pasture, with grey snow capped mountains in the distance. There's a gentle breeze
    rustling the grass to and fro. \n\nYou hear a child calling your name out the
    window slightly muffled behind the pane of glass. You can't quite make it out
    but you know it's intended for you.\n\n\"Yes, that's right. I'm late!\" you suggest
    to yourself rousing up your spirit. You open the window and look outside whe suddenly
    you hear the door open behind you.\n\n1. Continue."
