  storyText: 'You take a step back observing your surroundings. "No." you let out
    defiantly. "None of this is real. It''s a trick! I don''t believe any of it you
    hear me!? whatever it is you have me under, wake me up now and confront me!!"
    you shout with all your might.


    For a moment or two you hear nothing when suddenly you notice a page flip backward
    in the book. A second later, another page. Then several. The book pages are flipping
    back faster and faster as if a great wind entered the room!


    The toys and objects around the room begin to swirl around. You can''t observe
    where this force is coming from but it feels as if a small whirlwind is being
    conjured around the room!


    With greater and greater force it twists and spins. You lower yourself to the
    ground under the table but it''s no good. The walls and objects are now being
    torn and lifted up and away! the roof comes crashing in on you. The weight of
    everything is too heavy. Everything fades to black and all sound disappears.


    1. Game over.'
