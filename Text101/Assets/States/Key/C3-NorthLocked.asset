  storyText: 'You carefully move to the door intending not to trip over anything in
    the dimly lit room.


    As you reach for the doorknob you find the door firmly locked.


    Walking back you hear a slight shuffle as if someone just moved in the room. Pausing
    for a moment you wait to hear more but there is only silence.


    "Hmm, must be my nerves still rattled." you assure yourself.


    1. Return.'
