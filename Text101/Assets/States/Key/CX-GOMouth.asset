  storyText: 'Pulling the ring now violently thrusts you forward into it''s gaping
    mouth!


    The rings contort into lidless eyes and the wreathe forms into snarling lips.
    Your torso is now inward into the mouth! You catch your footing briefly and attempt
    to step back but it is no good. The mouth has now sealed itself shut to your torso.


    With a binding grip you feel the teeth of the door crushing your ribs as you scream
    in terror seeing everything fade to black.


    1. Game over.'
