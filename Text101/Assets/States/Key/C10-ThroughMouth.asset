  storyText: "You enter the narrow opening and trust your footing to carry you through
    the path. The noises you once heard have silenced. Navigating the darkness one
    step at a time with your hands to your sides you feel nothing but cold metallic
    walls. The ground sounds hard and hollow. You hear nothing but the sound of your
    breath, it sounds heavier than normal as if under a humid downpour and you notice
    slight perspiration forming on your skin.\n\nContinue down one step at a time
    you suddenly feel something catch your foot, entangling your balance and causing
    you to trip forward! You begin kicking off what appears to feel like a stiff hand,
    though it's still too dark to be sure. After several kicks you break free and
    press your hands to the flooring to rise up and rush to the room, though you can't
    help but feel there being something cold, viscous, and foul smelling on the grounds
    that your hands touched.\n\nStammering toward the light you can now see as you're
    getting closer it's an opening just enough to crawl through. You pick up in pace
    and see the light catching the walls and path you're in. As the surfaces catch
    the light you can see they're peeling downward on their own, and appear to be
    like tattered leather, worn, beige and brown with streaks of red pouring out.
    \n\nThe unsightly walls increase your heart rate as you continue to rush to the
    opening. Suddenly you hear heavy footsteps running behind you at a pace you can't
    beat, grunting, snorting, and dragging something metallic across the ground causing
    rusty screaches to pierce through the path.\n\nYou're near the opening now and
    you leap through it encountering a blinding light and silence...\n\n1. Continue..."
