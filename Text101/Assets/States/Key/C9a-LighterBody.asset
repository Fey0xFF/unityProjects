  storyText: "Approaching the figure you stoop down to see it's hand.\n\nReaching
    toward the hand it suddenly grips your arm! You try to pull away but it's grip
    is solidly locked on to you with unnatural strength. It's head twists around.
    The upper portion of it's face is all bandaged.\n\nYou're suddenly filled with
    a sense of dread and feel burdened by a heavy weight inside your chest. \n\nYou
    withdraw into a flashback. You see a familiar face, a loved one by your account.
    The two of you are laughing and you're apologizing over something small. Suddenly
    you're taken to a violent storm on a beach. Your hands are submered into the water
    gripping something tightly.\n\nYour eyes open once more and you come to. The hand
    is no longer gripping your arm, instead it is  holding a lighter. You reach for
    the lighter and pocked it. \n\nA breeze stirs up and most of the figure blows
    away into it.\n \n1. Return.\n"
