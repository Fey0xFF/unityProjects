  storyText: "You continue to reach for the pull ring. As your fingers grip the pull
    ring you feel the ring thrust you forward! losing your grip and footing you fall
    forward toward the opening that is now vastly larger than before.\n\n\"Whoa! what
    was that!?\" you announce quite startled while stepping back. \"Whatever labyrinth
    he's created, I'll find my way out of it! I need to find him!\" to declare to
    the door. \n\nRather suddenly In the distance you hear a sudden creaking of wood
    and a sharp but solid thud...\n\nWhat do you do?\n\n1. Return.\n2. Continue opening
    the door."
