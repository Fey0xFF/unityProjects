  storyText: "You lift your fingers slowly across the page inking your thoughts.\n\n-It
    was me!\n\nAs you lift your hands away, the book slams shut with such force that
    it gains some lift. Nothing happens for several moments when you start to hear
    some crumbling behind you. Turning around you notice the wall starting to shake
    ever so slightly as if a heavy vibration is behind it.\n\nYou step back looking
    to see what will happen when you notice your footsteps are hitting the ground
    harder. Looking down you see the flooring now that familiar grated metal again.
    Startled you fall back into the wall and see the room taking shape twisting it's
    surfaces inside out into terrible images. The walls begin to peel and the piercing
    sound of a motor belt snapping can be heard behind the wall when it suddenly crashes
    open! a large rusted rod pierces through following by a large heavy decaying hand
    feeling it's way around the opening!\n\nTurning around the room you notice a rodded
    door behind you. You leap towards it but it's locked! \"The key!\" you scream.
    Finding a slot for it you place the key inside and twist. \n\n-click!\n\nYou open
    the door and run further into the descent of madness.\n\n1. Continue."
