  storyText: "The burn ward is badly damaged by what was a violent onset fire once
    upon a time. It is a long and narrow hall laden with charred outlines of what
    once stood.\n\nMost of the room is not easily distinguishable, though strangely
    in the distance of hall you can only see blackness. The floor to the end is familiar.
    It's exposed metal grating floor like before... and torn up and bent downward
    into darkness. \n\nA charred figure is sitting near the edge with it's arm stretched
    out appearing to hold something...\n\nWhat do you do?\n\n1. Check the figure's
    hand.\n2. Return to the gardened area."
