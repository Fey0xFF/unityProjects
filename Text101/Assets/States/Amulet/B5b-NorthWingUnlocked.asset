  storyText: "Approaching the door you can hear pacing back and forth beyond it. Heavy
    steps, walking in circles. Every now and then you can hear sniffing and what sounds
    like drawers and cabinets opening with paper and various items being tossed around.
    A foul stench is eminating from beyond the door.\n\nYou silently step forward
    as deftly as you can and test the doorknob. It turns. You feel you can open it
    and continue and perhaps get the take on whatever is behind it. \n\n\"What options
    do I really have at this point!?\" you contend to yourself in despair. \"I need
    to find him. If it's the last thing I do! I need to know what happened!\" you
    claim to yourself in your mind. \n\nYou muster up some courage after considering
    that you may not be able to return if you enter...\n\nWhat do you do?\n\n1. Wait
    for the right moment and burst open the door. [no turning back from here, don't
    press anything after]\n2. Return."
