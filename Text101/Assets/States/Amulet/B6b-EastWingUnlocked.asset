  storyText: 'Looking around the room now it appears different. More floorboards than
    you can remember are now exposed and are displaying the eerie metal grating beneath.
    You can see the same black depths from before now behind it. The wallpaper now
    catching different lights as you look around almost appears to be peeling slowly.


    You see the door you came in from once more. "I don''t know what''s going on anymore
    but I need to get moving... now." you claim out loud with purpose.


    What do you do?


    1. Examine the scratches again.

    2. Read the note again.

    3. To the Main Wing.'
