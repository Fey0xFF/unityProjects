  storyText: 'The East Wing is heavily damaged. Something caught fire rapidly here.
    It looks to have begun in the center of the room on the flooring where an outline
    of some kind of demonic symbol was drawn out. "A ceremony?" you wonder. More oddly
    some of the floorboards that are burned away bear a similar grated look to your
    cage. "It cannot be..." you mutter to yourself sharpening your eyes at the sight
    of the metal.


    Looking around you notice there are some scratches marked along of the walls that
    look recently carved. Beneath the scratches you see a note laying along the floor.


    Many of contents of this room are hard to distinguish. For a moment you hear what
    sounds likea rusty wheelchair creak behind one of the curtains. You lean forward
    slightly and peer around the curtain seeing a broken wheelchair, and much to your
    relief nothing else.


    Coming back to where you were you begin darting your gaze to each wall of the
    room frantically! The door you entered from cannot be found. "This isn''t real!
    none of it. It can''t be!" you mutter to yourself wearily.


    Taking a deep breath you consider your options...


    1. Examine the scratches.

    2. Read the note.'
