  storyText: 'You''re in a long hallway. There''s a sign across one of the halls labelled
    "Medical Corridor", with a carved "H" next to it. "What does that mean?" you think
    to yourself.


    Hospital beds lay along the sides with various equipment rigged to them. The locked
    door you came in from sits at one end and there is a door at the other end ajar
    with a sign above saying "Main Wing".


    What do you do?


    1. Examine the amulet.

    2. Open the amulet.

    3. Go through the door to the Main Wing.'
