  storyText: 'This room appears to have been damaged by a small fire in the corner.
    A slightly charred smell is about.


    More hospital beds are strung across the sides of the room covered by curtains.
    Bandages are scattered around the room. You can hear a loud generator in the distance
    whirring.


    There''s a door marked North Wing that looks quite sturdy and fairly new compared
    to the surroundings.


    A door marked East Wing seems to be where the burn originated from.


    1. To the North Wing.

    2. To the East Wing.

    3. To the Medical Corridor.'
