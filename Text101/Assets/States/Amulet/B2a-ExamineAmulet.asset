  storyText: "The amulet is old in heritage by your count. Quite tarnished by time,
    yet not very damaged or used. Strangely a little water looks like it seeped out
    from inside during the fall. \n\nThere is something barely legible scribed across
    the back and just enough lighting in here to catch the edges and bear words:\n\n-A.
    Almes\n\n\"The name is familiar in my memory yet it doesn't feel quite right...\"
    you ponder for a moment. It also looks as if the was another name etched underneath
    it, overwritten by \"A. Almes\" now.\n\nDaringly you speak to yourself \"I must
    have had this all along and dropped the key in the fall. I must work my way out
    now!\"\n \n1. Put the amulet away."
