  storyText: 'The Medical Corridor carries the same signs as the rest of the place
    now. The door you came from has been torn off now however and just a black emptyness
    remains beyond it. There are faint sounds of a baby crying in the distance now
    and again followed by a loud crash of an object. Chills run down your spine.

    E. "It can''t be... " you think to yourself.


    1. Examine the amulet.

    2. Open the amulet.
