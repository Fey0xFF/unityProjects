    Your senses must be muddled. Perhaps you should have paid more attention to whatever
    was going on with that spelling and bizarre message. "What did that note say again!?"
    you manage to slip out.


    The doppelganger rushes toward you hoisting you up in the air with unnatural strength.
    It raises one of it''s morbidly twisted hands and rings it around your neck. With
    a swift clench of it''s grip you feel you''re unable to breathe. Your hands flail
    and try to assail the attack, though it''s futile at best.


    Your eyes close and you feel your life drift away as the doppelganger roars in
    victory.


    1. Continue.'
