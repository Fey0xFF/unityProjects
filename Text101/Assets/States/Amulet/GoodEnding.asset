  storyText: '"S..." you begin to say.


    "Sam" you get out further! "Samael!" You decry out loud! uncertain of what it
    is but knowing what it could be...


    The doppelganger steps back slowly. It begins to laugh a gargled laugh.


    With a fiery rage you announce "You''re not me! you''re a copy, and nothing more!"


    The monstrosity''s face and neck begin to shake violently. It''s body fidgeting.
    With a guttural roar it''s arms stretch out and the room begins to rupture upwards.
    Walls shake and various spots around the ground begin to shatter and fall into
    blackness. The flooring behind starts to give away and to usher yourself forward.


    With great speed and anger, the doppelganger starts rushing towards you. Though,
    it''s face seems to bear it''s true form now, a hideous sight it is, but it''s
    no longer you! It leaps in the air to jump on you. Turning to the side bracing
    for impact you feel the amulet slip out of your shirt. There''s a sharp light
    coming from inside it now and it beams upwards blinding the beast as it''s coming
    your way. It loses it''s sight of you and goes off course slipping past you tumbling
    over the edge of the flooring. It tries to catch the edge with it''s clawing fingers
    but only manages to graze your arm instead tearing your flesh as it falls and
    leaving you wincing at the pain clenching your jaw.


    You turn to the side further to see the beast falling into the depths as it booms
    a mighty guttural roar at you.


    Seemingly as everything continues to fall around you, you are at peace. Things
    feel right inside you now. The physical pain begins to dissipate and the terrors
    you witnessed seem so long ago.


    Your vision begins to fade to white and all sounds go silent.


    You then feel your senses faintly coming to but you''re not able to visualize
    your surroundings. Everything is white as if a great light is covering all things.
    You hear a gentle soft feminine voice to your ear "It''s alright now. Open your
    eyes dear..."
