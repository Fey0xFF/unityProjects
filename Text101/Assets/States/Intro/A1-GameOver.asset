  storyText: "You close your eyes gently remaining still. It's quiety peaceful.\n\nFor
    a moment or two nothing happens until you hear an infrequent drip coming closer
    to your face. Shortly after a wretched smell begins to take hold of your senses.\n\nOpening
    your eyes you're startled in horror seeing a ghastly porcelain white face with
    a jaw dropped bearing rows of razer sharp teeth with a sneering smile. It's eyes
    are bleeding and dripping down it's cheeks of cracked skin. It's motionless but
    clearly staring into your eyes and is no further than a few inches from your face.\n\nYou
    try to move but cannot. You're paralyzed in fear. You draw your eyes to the side
    and see a shadowy black hand reach out of the darkness and grip your throat. \n\nYou
    gasp and soon lose sight of everything...\n\n1. Game over."
