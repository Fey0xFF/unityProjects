  storyText: "As you consider your options you note your body is colder than normal.
    You can only see a metallic wall in front of you and  grated floor beneath you.
    You can see through the grating but it\x19's black as if you\x19're suspended
    in a cage above an endless depth.\n\nThere isn't a sound to be heard.\n\nWhat
    do you do?\n\n1. Close your eyes a little longer and wait to see what happens.\n2.
    Push yourself up slowly, stand up and look around.\n3. Call out for help."
