  storyText: 'Remaining still you scream out "Hello!" answered only by silence.


    "Where am I!?" you scream out once more.


    Nothing.


    After a moment, in the distance beneath the grating you hear what can only be
    described as an old wooden chair dragged across wooden boards. You shutter ever
    so slightly.


    1. Get up and look around.

    2. Remain still a bit more and call out once again.'
