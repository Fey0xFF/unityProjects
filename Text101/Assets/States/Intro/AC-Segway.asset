  storyText: "Your eyes struggle to open and falter closed several times before coming
    to.\n\nYou look around noting your surroundings. You're laying down on a worn
    black sofa, next to you are some chairs, a door is across from you with a pane
    of discolored glass obstructing what is inside it. Around the room you can see
    various medical equipment and devices. You're clearly in a medical lab or hospital
    of some kind, though, seemingly abandoned by the looks of the worn wallpaper,
    and broken upholstery.\n\n\"No better place to be after taking such a fall!\"
    you casually suggest to yourself trying to ease your nerves. \n\nYou press yourself
    up and look about the room. \"How did I get here? At least this area looks like
    I'm awake now and not in some nightmare cage.\" you recant nervously. \n\n\"A
    terrible dream or induced coma I'm sure after getting knocked out in that alley...\"
    you think you to yourself.\n\n\"Hello!?\" you shout. No response.\n\nPressing
    yourself up off the couch you motion over to the door. It's unlocked.\n\nOpening
    the door you step out. The door shuts behind you and you hear it lock. The thought
    comes to your mind \"Not any good to go back in there at this point.\" \n\n1.
    Continue...\n"
