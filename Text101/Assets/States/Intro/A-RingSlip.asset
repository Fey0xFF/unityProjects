  storyText: "Fool of a took! you shouldn't be putting on rings you don't know about!\n\nSlipping
    on the ring you feel a great power come over you and can see the real intentions
    of everything around you. You reckon you're a force that cannot be trifled with
    anymore!\n\nSuddenly, there is a great eye looming above over you!\n\nYou tremble
    in terror at the sight as the eye rushes toward you whispering terrible sounds.
    \n\nYou try taking off the ring but it's no good. It doesn't budge! you look to
    your hands and see your skin becoming translucent, almost wightish. You're definitely
    not Frodo and don't have that hobbit resilience +1 to all things dark and terrible.
    \n\nWith enough forcing you manage to slip the ring off. \n \n1. Return back to
    the real story!"
