  storyText: "You get up and look around the room. It's dimly lit by a light hanging
    above the grating.\n\nYou notice there is no door. The walls are bolted sheet
    metal, heavily rusted and worn. You look up noticing the same grating above the
    ceiling.\n\nThere is only a small wooden dresser in front of you that looks damaged
    by time. On top you see a tarnished silver amulet and next to it a small worn
    steel key. Strangely it looks like the dresser had been dragged at one point covering
    something underneath.\n\nYou take a step forward and the echo of your step resounds
    in the dark depths. \n\nSuddenly you hear steps of a heavy boot coming your way
    above you and picking up in pace. The steps are followed by a hollow clinking
    of metal dragging across the grating.\n\nYou don't have many options, but you
    need to grab one of these items for a clue. What do you do?\n\n1. Grab the amulet.\n2.
    Grab the key."
