  storyText: "You reach for the amulet and feel the grating beneath you begin to rattle.\n\nThe
    steps above begin to pick up faster in pace now running toward your direction.
    \n\nYou continue reaching for it and grab the amulet. You hold it up to the light
    for a moment to see more detail. Your attention is taken away suddenly when the
    grating in front of you collapses taking the dresser and key with it.\n\n\"What's
    happening!?\" you question to yourself. \"This can't be real!\" you fester over
    the throught in fear. The grating beneath your feet unhinges to one side.\n\nGripping
    the amulet tightly you leap upwards and manage to find your fingers gripping between
    the metal grid pattern of the perceived roof of the cage you're in.\n\nThe grated
    floor tiles give away completely now and fall into the nothingness clanking against
    one another.\n\nIn all the commotion you forgot steps coming your way! you look
    up and see a thick heavy leather boot come crashing down upon your fingers!\n\nReeling
    in pain you feel your grip release and fall down into the abyss seeing the image
    of the cage dwindling out of sight.\n\nYou let out something of a gutteral scream
    of terror only to have the blackness drown out your sound and quickly cannot tell
    whether you're still breathing or not. You fall a height you cannot determine
    until you suddenly feel your head thud against something and lose conscious...\n\n1.
